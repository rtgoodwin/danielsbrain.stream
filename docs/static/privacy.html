    <h2>
      About
    </h2>

    Daniel's Brain ("DB", "The Application") is a voice response application for popular services like Amazon Alexa and
    Google Assistant ("Voice Services"). It provides funny sayings and quotations from cast members of the Dudley and
    Bob Morning show, on KLBJ FM in Austin, Texas. The application has no affiliation with the KLBJ broadcast entity,
    and is provided by Goody Apps Good, the application development branding of Richard Goodwin ("Developer", "we",
    "us").

    <h2>
      Data Collection
    </h2>

    In plain terms, DB does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). The Voice Services that serve
    the DB application may collect and provide analytic information so that the Developer can improve the application.
    This includes anonymous information in the form of how often the application is used, for how long, errors
    encountered, and what geographical regions the users are using the app from. This is similar to how analytics works
    for basically any website that is in existence today (March 2019), and is used SOLELY to improve the stability and
    usability of DB.

    DB does not serve ads, nor link to any user accounts.

    The DB website, DanielsBrain.stream, does not use cookies or data collection of any kind to "remember" users, nor
    does it collect any personally identifiable analytics information.

    Any data collected through any of the above means will be used SOLELY to:
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the Application </li>
      <li>To notify you about changes to our Service</li>
      <li>To provide analysis or valuable information so that we can improve the Application</li>
      <li>To monitor the usage of the Application</li>
      <li>To detect, prevent and address technical issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Links To Other Sites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link,
      you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every
      site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
      party sites or services.</p>


    <h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
      Policy on this page.</p>
